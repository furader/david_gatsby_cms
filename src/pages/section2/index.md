    quote: David was incredible and we’ve had some great feedback already from our
      analysts and leadership team that were there. We were engaged, inspired
      and enjoyed every minute of his keynote.
  - author: Samsung
    quote: Your insights and perspective into the companies and entrepreneurs who
      are changing the world created a buzz around those assembled.
  - author: Terrapinn
    quote: We had nothing but praise for his forward thinking piece, it was both
      informative and entertaining. I didn’t see a single attendee checking
      their smartphone during David’s talk, which is a testament to his skill as
      a speaker. I will definitely recommend him to our other offices around the
      world.
